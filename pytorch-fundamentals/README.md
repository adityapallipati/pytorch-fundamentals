# PyTorch Fundamentals

## What is PyTorch?

[PyTorch]('https://pytorch.org/') is an opensource machine learning and deep learning framework.

## What can PyTorch be used for?

PyTorch allows you to manipulate and process data and write machine learning algorithms using Python code.

## Notebook Constraints

For my notebooks, I am running (mostly) everything locally on an M1 Macbook Pro with 16 GB of RAM. While Colab is an option, I wanted to work within the restraints of my local machine to get a better grasp of PyTorch under specific constraints, for example, if in a corporate environemnt where I'm not able to access larger compute instances I'd want to be able to work efficiently under those constraints.

With that said, I will be using colab from time to utilize GPUs to ensure there isn't a knowledge gap in that area.
